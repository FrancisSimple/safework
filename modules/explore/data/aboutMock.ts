  summary: "I am Francis Kwame Sewor, a Software Engineer and Senior Computer Engineering Student at Ashesi University. I don't just write code for the cloud; I build solutions that solve real problems on the ground—whether that's managing livestock in a backyard or deploying microservices for a health-tech platform.",

      title: 'The Origin: 10 Years in the Mud',
      content: "My engineering journey didn't begin with a laptop. It began with 10 years of rearing animals—goats, sheep, and fowl—alongside my mother and brother at home.\n\nThat experience taught me things no textbook could. I learned that systems fail (animals get sick), scalability is hard (feeding 50 birds is different from feeding 5), and that hard work is non-negotiable.\n\nIt was in those muddy backyards that I realized the gap between traditional farming and modern technology. That frustration became the seed for 'Animgrow,' my Livestock-as-a-Service platform. I am not just building an app for farmers; I am building it for my past self.",

      title: 'The Forge: Ashesi & Leadership',
      content: "I am currently finishing my major in Computer Engineering at Ashesi University (Class of 2026). Ashesi didn't just teach me syntax; it taught me ethics and leadership.\n\nBeyond the classroom, I served as a Resident Assistant (Sept 2025 - May 2026), where I was responsible for the well-being of my peers. It taught me empathy and crisis management—skills that surprisingly make me a better engineer.\n\nAcademically, I fell in love with the hard stuff: Embedded Systems, Assembly Language, and Operating Systems. While others ran to pure software, I stayed late in the lab figuring out how to make an STM32 microcontroller talk to a sensor. I believe true power lies where hardware meets software.",

      title: 'The Spark: BinByte Technologies',
      content: "I realized early on that I couldn't do it alone. This drive pushed me to co-found BinByte Technologies alongside brilliant friends from KNUST and Legon.\n\nWe wanted to create a hub where young developers could transition from 'learning' to 'building.' At BinByte, we train developers and take on real client projects. It is chaotic, exciting, and deeply rewarding. It proves that young Ghanaian engineers can build world-class software if given the chance.",

      title: 'The Mission: Solving Real Problems',
      content: "I don't believe in building 'toy apps.' Every project I touch targets a specific, painful problem:\n\n• Animgrow: Solving the investment gap in agriculture.\n• Kura: Bringing transparency to student elections via a secure voting app.\n• Poctor (Pocket Doctor): Using AI to bridge the healthcare gap in remote areas.\n\nI use tools like Flutter, FastAPI, Docker, and Git not because they are trendy, but because they get the job done reliably.",
